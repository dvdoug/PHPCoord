Installation
============

The recommended way to install PHPCoord is to use `Composer`_. From the command line simply execute the following to add
``php-coord/php-coord`` to your project's ``composer.json`` file. Composer will automatically take care of downloading the source
and configuring an autoloader:

.. code::

    composer require php-coord/php-coord

The code is also available to download from `GitHub`_
