Installation
============

The recommended way to install PHPCoord is to use `Composer`_. From the command line simply execute the following to add
``php-coord/php-coord`` to your project's ``composer.json`` file. Composer will automatically take care of downloading the source
and configuring an autoloader:

.. code::

    composer require php-coord/php-coord

For :ref:`increased accuracy<accuracy>` of conversions, you may wish to install one or more optional add-on datapacks:

* ``php-coord/datapack-africa``
* ``php-coord/datapack-antarctic``
* ``php-coord/datapack-arctic``
* ``php-coord/datapack-asia``
* ``php-coord/datapack-europe``
* ``php-coord/datapack-northamerica``
* ``php-coord/datapack-oceania``
* ``php-coord/datapack-southamerica``

The code for the core package and the datapacks is also available to download from `GitHub`_
