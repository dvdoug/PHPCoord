The hard way
============
Each type of ``Point`` has methods you can invoke to run well-known algorithmic conversions on its coordinates.

They are listed in detail on the following pages.

.. tip::
    The first parameter of every method is always a ``CoordinateReferenceSystem`` object representing the target
    CRS. For guidance on remaining parameters, please see a textbook as explaining them is far outside the
    scope of this documentation.
