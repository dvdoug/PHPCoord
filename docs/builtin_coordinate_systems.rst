Built in axis systems
=====================

.. note::
    In ISO 19111 terminology (and PHPCoord code), this concept is called a *Coordinate System*

.. tip::
    Unless you are trying to work with a coordinate reference system that doesn't exist in the built-in set, you don't
    need to worry about these, the correct one will be instantiated for you.
