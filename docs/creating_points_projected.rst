Projected points
================
A projected point is one that has an *east-west* distance and a *north-south* distance. These are most often called
*eastings* and *northings*, but sometimes *westings* and/or *southings* are used instead. Some coordinate systems eschew
directional naming and use just *x* and *y* instead, the meaning of which varies. PHPCoord's input always uses the
directional naming system.

If you have coordinates ``(x,y,h)``, then you will need a both a ``ProjectedPoint`` and a ``VerticalPoint`` and then to tie
them together with a ``CompoundPoint``.

.. caution::
    Do not confuse ``(x,y,h)`` with ``(x,y,z)``. ``(x,y,z)`` is used by Geocentric coordinate systems.



A ``ProjectedPoint`` can be constructed by calling one of the ``ProjectedPoint::create*`` methods, which have the
following signatures:

.. code-block:: php

    public static function createFromEastingNorthing(
        Length $easting,
        Length $northing,
        Projected $crs,
        ?DateTimeInterface $epoch = null
    ): ProjectedPoint

    public static function createFromWestingNorthing(
        Length $westing,
        Length $northing,
        Projected $crs,
        ?DateTimeInterface $epoch = null
    ): ProjectedPoint

    public static function createFromWestingSouthing(
        Length $westing,
        Length $southing,
        Projected $crs,
        ?DateTimeInterface $epoch = null
    ): ProjectedPoint

Examples:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use PHPCoord\CoordinateReferenceSystem\Projected;
    use PHPCoord\ProjectedPoint;
    use PHPCoord\UnitOfMeasure\Length\Metre;

    // Nelson's Column in British National Grid (unknown date), traditional arguments
    $crs = Projected::fromSRID(Projected::EPSG_OSGB_1936_BRITISH_NATIONAL_GRID);
    $point = ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing(
        new Metre(530017),
        new Metre(180419),
        $crs
    );

    // Nelson's Column in British National Grid (2020-02-01), traditional arguments
    $crs = Projected::fromSRID(Projected::EPSG_OSGB_1936_BRITISH_NATIONAL_GRID);
    $point = ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing(
        new Metre(530017),
        new Metre(180419),
        $crs,
        new DateTime('2020-02-01')
    );

    // Nelson's Column in British National Grid (unknown date), named arguments
    $crs = Projected::fromSRID(Projected::EPSG_OSGB_1936_BRITISH_NATIONAL_GRID);
    $point = ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing(
        easting: new Metre(530017),
        northing: new Metre(180419),
        crs: $crs
    );

    // Nelson's Column in British National Grid (2020-02-01), named arguments
    $crs = Projected::fromSRID(Projected::EPSG_OSGB_1936_BRITISH_NATIONAL_GRID);
    $point = ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing(
        easting: new Metre(530017),
        northing: new Metre(180419),
        epoch: new DateTime('2020-02-01'),
        crs: $crs
    );

    $easting = $point->getEasting(); // Length
    $northing = $point->getNorthing(); // Length
    $epoch = $point->getCoordinateEpoch(); // DateTimeImmutable|null
    $crs = $point->getCRS(); // Projected
    $asString = (string) $point; // '(530017, 180419)'

British National Grid
---------------------
.. sidebar:: GB grid references

    .. image:: images/osgb.png

(also known as Ordnance Survey National Grid)

In Great Britain, the convention is not to use as-is the easting and northing coordinates produced by the projection.
The country is divided into sub-grids of 100km×100km which are given 2 letter codes, and then coordinates are given
referenced to their position within the subgrid rather than the national origin. Thus, Nelson's Column
``(530017, 180419)`` would usually be referred to as ``TQ 30017 80419``. Exchanging numbers for letters in this way
sounds complex, but having the grid letters aids greatly in finding the right map sheet when working with paper
maps.

Using the letters also clearly distinguishes between "pure" eastings/northings and the grid system. This has the benefit
that it becomes permissible to truncate coordinates when full metre-level precision is not required, e.g. when trying to
locate a building. For example, if just trying to locate Trafalger Square as a whole rather than specifically Nelson's
statue, a coordinate like ``TQ 300 804`` could be given which is accurate to ~100m. This would not be possible to give
purely numerically, as it could be confused with an actual full coordinate for a different point.

A ``BritishNationalGridPoint`` is automatically created from ``ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing()`` if
the relevant CRS is supplied - the examples above all actually create a ``BritishNationalGridPoint``
rather than a standard ``ProjectedPoint``. Alternatively, you can construct one directly.

.. code-block:: php

    // from full eastings and northings
    public function __construct(
        Length $easting,
        Length $northing,
        ?DateTimeInterface $epoch = null
    ): BritishNationalGridPoint

    // from  a grid reference
    public static function fromGridReference(
        string $reference,
        ?DateTimeInterface $epoch = null
    ): BritishNationalGridPoint

Examples:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use PHPCoord\CoordinateReferenceSystem\Projected;
    use PHPCoord\BritishNationalGridPoint;
    use PHPCoord\ProjectedPoint;
    use PHPCoord\UnitOfMeasure\Length\Metre;

    // Nelson's Column
    $crs = Projected::fromSRID(Projected::EPSG_OSGB_1936_BRITISH_NATIONAL_GRID);
    $point = ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing(
        new Metre(530017),
        new Metre(180419),
        $crs
    );

    // also Nelson's Column
    $point = new BritishNationalGridPoint(new Metre(530017), new Metre(180419)); // CRS is implied

    // also Nelson's Column
    $point = BritishNationalGridPoint::fromGridReference('TQ 30017 80419'); // CRS is implied

    $isBritishGrid = $point instanceof BritishNationalGridPoint; //true
    $asString = (string) $point; // '(530017, 180419)'
    $asString = $point->asGridReference(10); // 'TQ3001780419'
    $asString = $point->asGridReference(6); // 'TQ300804'
    $asString = $point->asGridReferenceWithSpaces(10); // 'TQ 30017 80419'
    $asString = $point->asGridReferenceWithSpaces(6); // 'TQ 300 804'

Irish Grid
----------
Ireland adopted a similar system to Britain that also uses grid letters. Each 100km×100km grid square in Ireland is
identified by a single letter rather than by two, in other respects the system is near identical.

A ``IrishGridPoint`` is automatically created from ``ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing()`` if
the relevant CRS is supplied. Alternatively, you can construct one directly.

.. code-block:: php

    // from full eastings and northings
    public function __construct(
        Length $easting,
        Length $northing,
        ?DateTimeInterface $epoch = null
    ): IrishGridPoint

    // from  a grid reference
    public static function fromGridReference(
        string $reference,
        ?DateTimeInterface $epoch = null
    ): IrishGridPoint

Examples:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use PHPCoord\CoordinateReferenceSystem\Projected;
    use PHPCoord\IrishGridPoint;
    use PHPCoord\ProjectedPoint;
    use PHPCoord\UnitOfMeasure\Length\Metre;

    // Spire of Dublin
    $crs = Projected::fromSRID(Projected::EPSG_TM75_IRISH_GRID);
    $point = ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing(
        new Metre(315904),
        new Metre(234671),
        $crs
    );

    // also Spire of Dublin
    $point = new IrishGridPoint(new Metre(315904), new Metre(234671)); // CRS is implied

    // also Spire of Dublin
    $point = IrishGridPoint::fromGridReference('O1590434671'); // CRS is implied

    $isIrishGrid = $point instanceof IrishGridPoint; //true
    $asString = (string) $point; // '(315904, 234671)'
    $asString = $point->asGridReference(10); // 'O1590434671'
    $asString = $point->asGridReference(6); // 'O159346'
    $asString = $point->asGridReferenceWithSpaces(10); // 'O 15904 34671'
    $asString = $point->asGridReferenceWithSpaces(6); // 'O 159 346'

Irish Transverse Mercator
-------------------------
In 2001, Ireland introduced a replacement system for the Irish Grid system known as Irish Transverse Mercator (ITM).
In ITM eastings and northings are always given in full. ITM does not use grid letters.

Nonetheless, PHPCoord comes with a dedicated ``IrishTransverseMercatorPoint`` class. This class exists only to try and
mitigate any confusion in advance between the two systems - a developer who was not aware of the older system, might
accidentally try to use a ``IrishGridPoint`` thinking it was the right thing to do when they actually have coordinates
in the ITM system. The class has no additional functionality over a standard ``ProjectedPoint``.

.. code-block:: php

    // from full eastings and northings
    public function __construct(
        Length $easting,
        Length $northing,
        ?DateTimeInterface $epoch = null
    ): IrishTransverseMercatorPoint

Examples:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use PHPCoord\CoordinateReferenceSystem\Projected;
    use PHPCoord\IrishTransverseMercatorPoint;
    use PHPCoord\ProjectedPoint;
    use PHPCoord\UnitOfMeasure\Length\Metre;

    // Spire of Dublin
    $crs = Projected::fromSRID(Projected::EPSG_IRENET95_IRISH_TRANSVERSE_MERCATOR);
    $point = ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing(
        new Metre(715830),
        new Metre(734697),
        $crs
    );

    // also Spire of Dublin
    $point = new IrishTransverseMercatorPoint(new Metre(715830), new Metre(734697)); // CRS is implied

    $isITM = $point instanceof IrishTransverseMercatorPoint; //true
    $asString = (string) $point; // '(715830, 734697)'

.. _utm_points:

Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
-----------------------------------
Although one of the most widely used applications of the Transverse Mercator projection, UTM is not actually a map
projection. It's a *system* of map projections, and this distinction means that it does not fit neatly into the
standard data model. Mathematically each UTM zone/hemisphere combination is its own unique projection and
therefore to work with the data you also need to know which zone/hemisphere the coordinates are reference to.
Adding a further layer of complication is that although UTM is most commonly used alongside WGS84, it can be used with
any Geographic CRS so that information needs to be known as well.

PHPCoord has 3 ways to handle this issue.

Treat each zone/hemisphere as a fully independent projection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Pros: no confusion about what the coordinates represent
| Cons: when converting to UTM, you need to know in advance which zone/hemisphere the points reside in

For many ``Geographic`` CRSs, there are corresponding dedicated ``Projected`` CRS for each individual UTM zone and
hemisphere. In total there are over 1000 individual such CRSs defined.

Examples:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use PHPCoord\CoordinateReferenceSystem\Projected;
    use PHPCoord\ProjectedPoint;
    use PHPCoord\UnitOfMeasure\Length\Metre;

    // Piazza San Marco, Venice
    $crs = Projected::fromSRID(Projected::EPSG_WGS_84_UTM_ZONE_33N);
    $point = ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing(
        new Metre(291789),
        new Metre(5034599),
        $crs
    );

    // Piazza San Marco, Venice
    $crs = Projected::fromSRID(Projected::EPSG_ETRS89_UTM_ZONE_33N);
    $point = ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing(
        new Metre(291789),
        new Metre(5034599),
        $crs
    );

Prefix easting with the zone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Pros: you only have to know the hemisphere when converting to UTM (latitude ± 0)
| Cons: coordinates are not distances, WGS84 only

Because the previously described system has some practical difficulties in use when working with points that are not
all from within a single zone, this alternate mechanism is sometimes used. It works by (ab)using the easting coordinate
to store the zone number alongside the actual coordinate resulting from the projection.

.. warning::
    Normally the coordinates of a map projection represent real distances on the ground. For UTM, these would be
    distance in metres from the origin. However when zone numbers are incorporated into the easting in this way, then
    that is no longer true - an easting of 32500000 and an easting of 33500000 are **not** 1000000m apart.

    The prefix-based mechanism is made available in PHPCoord for interoperability with other systems, but is discouraged
    for use.

Example:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use PHPCoord\CoordinateReferenceSystem\Projected;
    use PHPCoord\ProjectedPoint;
    use PHPCoord\UnitOfMeasure\Length\Metre;

    // Piazza San Marco, Venice
    $crs = Projected::fromSRID(Projected::EPSG_WGS_84_UTM_GRID_SYSTEM_NORTHERN_HEMISPHERE);
    $point = ProjectedPoint::createFromEastingNorthing(
        new Metre(33291789), // UTM is defined as metres, but this coordinate is actually not...
        new Metre(5034599),
        $crs
    );

Treat UTM as special
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
| Pros: no pre-calculation needed to determine hemisphere or zone number when converting
| Cons: potentially less interoperability with other systems (does not fit into the EPSG data model)

PHPCoord also offers a way to work with UTM where the zone number and hemisphere are treated as first-class aspects of
the data model rather than shoehorned into one of the coordinates or needing to be extrapolated from the name of the CRS.
This is done via ``UTMPoint`` which is a specialised extension of ``ProjectedPoint``.

.. code-block:: php

    public function __construct(
        Length $easting,
        Length $northing,
        int $zone,
        string $hemisphere, //one of UTMPoint::HEMISPHERE_NORTH or UTMPoint::HEMISPHERE_SOUTH
        Geographic $crs,
        ?DateTimeInterface $epoch = null
    ): UTMPoint

Example:

.. code-block:: php

    <?php
    use PHPCoord\CoordinateReferenceSystem\Geographic;
    use PHPCoord\UTMPoint;
    use PHPCoord\UnitOfMeasure\Length\Metre;

    // Piazza San Marco, Venice
    $crs = Geographic2D::fromSRID(Geographic2D::EPSG_WGS_84);
    $point = new UTMPoint(
        new Metre(291789),
        new Metre(5034599),
        33,
        UTMPoint::HEMISPHERE_NORTH,
        $crs
    );

    $easting = $point->getEasting(); // Metre
    $northing = $point->getNorthing(); // Metre
    $zone = $point->getZone(); // int
    $hemisphere = $point->getHemisphere(); // UTMPoint::HEMISPHERE_NORTH|UTMPoint::HEMISPHERE_SOUTH
    $epoch = $point->getCoordinateEpoch(); // DateTimeImmutable|null
    $baseCRS = $point->getBaseCRS(); // Geographic
    $crs = $point->getCRS(); // Projected (synthesised at runtime, not one from the built-in EPSG set)
    $asString = (string) $point; // '33N 291789 5034599'
