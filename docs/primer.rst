A quick primer on geodesy concepts
==================================

Coordinates are hard. If they were easy, you wouldn't have needed to find this library. The below is intended as a quick
guide to the basic concepts involved in geodesy (the science of measuring the Earth's shape) intended to allow you to
more fully understand the terminology used within the library. It is **not** necessary to read or memorise this
documentation section to use the library, it's just here for educational purposes.

What is a coordinate?
---------------------

.. sidebar:: X marks the spot

    .. image:: images/piratemap.jpg

A coordinate (or set of coordinates) is a reference to a particular point on the Earth, or in the near vicinity of it
(e.g. the location of an aeroplane flying from A to B can still be identified by coordinates). Points are identified by a set
of distances (and direction) from a known starting point. A simple example would be a pirate map saying that the
buried treasure is 200 paces south-east of the old palm tree. Modern mapping doesn't measure distances from random trees,
but the principle is the same - pick a starting point and measure out distance(s) in the specified direction(s).

But how can someone find that starting point to start counting from? How does a treasure hunter find the right palm tree
(or even the right town?). You could measure out as a set of distances from a different tree, but that leads to circularity
very quickly. The answer is to special-case the starting point and to define it differently in terms of the physical
characteristics of the Earth. Pirate maps have pictures of coves and other local landmarks for this purpose, serious
mapping uses *science*.

Datums
^^^^^^
Technically, a datum is a set of described measurements to be performed on the Earth. The results of the measurements
give the known starting point. Sometimes, when repeating what in theory are the same measurements different results are
obtained - this can be because of simple error, or can also be because newer measurements are able to use more precise
measuring techniques. Where this occurs, each set of measurements is termed a new *realisation* of the same datum.

Most datums have only ever had 1 realisation made, and therefore the word datum usually refers to the results rather
than the method.

There are two types of datum: *geodetic* and *vertical*. The next few sections relate to the geodetic kind, vertical
datums are covered further below.

Ellipsoids
""""""""""
Before dividing the world into latitudes and longitudes or whatever other system is used, the first thing that needs to
be agreed on is the shape and size of the planet. Otherwise, my latitude/longitude grid\ [#f1]_ and your latitude/longitude
grid won't match up.

Although the Earth is normally pictured as spherical, it is actually very slightly wider at the equator than between
the north and south poles making it more elliptical in nature. A 3D ellipse is called an *ellipsoid*. The Earth is not a
perfect ellipsoid, it's more lumpy and bumpy than that but for the purposes of actually being able to perform any
calculations at all, slight distortions from reality are usually accepted.

.. sidebar:: A global ellipsoid

    .. image:: images/ellipsoidgeocentric.jpg

However, historically there has not been a unified view of what those distortions should be. Nowadays, many
(most?) coordinates are generated by devices making use of GPS and other such similar global satellite systems. By their
very nature, needing to work worldwide, a great deal of effort was made to pick an ellipsoid that minimised distortions
on a global basis. Even with that effort, new measurements and refinements from improving satellite technologies
resulted in evolution of the scientific consensus on the dimensions of the true "best-fit" ellipsoid several times and
therefore different mapping systems make use of different ellipsoids.

.. sidebar:: A regional ellipsoid

    .. image:: images/ellipsoidlocal.jpg

Before satellite positioning though, mapping was usually done by surveying and on a much more regional basis. It was
therefore commonplace for such mapping to purposefully make use of an ellipsoid that was a closer match to the actual
Earth surface in the area of interest, with the greater resulting mismatch from reality in parts of the globe that
weren't going to feature on the map being perfectly acceptable.

Thus, one of the most common reasons for needing to convert coordinates is that the source system and target system are
based on entirely different ellipsoids.

Axes
""""
Since we live in a 3D world, for full accuracy it is necessary to use 3 axes to describe the distance and direction of our
point of interest from the known starting point (which I'll call the origin going forward). For simplicity, we'll ignore
height for now and assume all points are at surface level. Thus, 2 axes are needed. Keeping in line with the philosophy
of using physical attributes of the Earth to define things, a consistent practice of using North-South and East-West for
these axes has been used since the time of the Ancient Greeks.

North-South
'''''''''''
For measurements along the north-south axis, the easiest thing to do is to define 0 to be the halfway point between the
two poles. Thus, in a latitude/longitude based system 0° latitude is the line around the equator. All geodetic datums
use this definition.

East-West
'''''''''
There is no East Pole or West Pole, so unfortunately the same type of physical definition cannot be used to pick where
to place the east-west axis. There are actually an infinite number of possible choices, the decision is essentially
arbitrary. Because of this, the choice of where to draw the 0 line must be recorded as part of the datum definition.
The chosen location is called the *Prime Meridian*.

The Ancient Greeks picked the westernmost point of the known world to be their Prime Meridian, which came with the
helpful property for them that all longitudes were positive numbers. As map-making became more scientific in nature in
the 18th century, many countries started using meridians that passed through their capital cities - e.g. French maps
used Paris, German maps used Berlin. This was probably at least partially for reasons of national pride but also since
longitude was more difficult to determine in those days, having the known 0 reference point inside the territory
will have had practical benefits to those doing the measuring.

Eventually, international agreement was reached to standardise on a single meridian worldwide, that choice being the one
passing through the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.

.. note::

    From the above, you may have realised that the origin point for north-south measurements (the equator), and the
    origin point for east-west (typically Greenwich) can be several thousand miles away from each other on completely
    different continents. This seems very complicated compared to the pirate map. Wouldn't it be simpler to simply pick
    the Royal Observatory as (0,0) and measure everything from that single point?

    The answer is that to measure distances in the way pirate maps do it requires either direct access to the origin point
    to measure out directly from (it had better be close!) or a network of other points with known
    coordinates that you can measure indirectly from. In fact, surveying makes heavy use of this very principle even today.
    However, it is not always practicable to find such points with known coordinates to measure from - for instance in
    remote areas, or for ships at sea.

    With the right equipment and training, it is however possible to make standalone measurements of latitude and
    longitude from anywhere on the planet. This is useful.

Ellipsoid height
''''''''''''''''
.. sidebar:: The ellipsoid vs reality

    .. image:: images/ellipsoidheight.png

Height is a concept that intuitively sounds very simple, but gets complicated very quickly (there is a section below
that expands on this). For now however, remember that the ellipsoidal model of the Earth is just an approximation, which
means this imaginary ellipsoid sometimes passes underneath "true" ground level, and sometimes passes above it.
Thus, although "height" above or below the ellipsoid can theoretically be calculated and used to accurately place a point
within a 3D space, it is of very limited practical use on the ground since the ellipsoid cannot actually be seen.

Coordinate reference systems (CRSs)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A Coordinate Reference System, is the combination of a *Datum* and a *Coordinate System* which is the particular set of
axes being used to measure distances on.

It is very important to know the set of axes being used, because otherwise numbers are very prone to misintepretation -
for example ``42.0669, 11.8128`` would be near Rome if the order is (latitude, longitude), but near Djibouti if the
order is (longitude, latitude). That's assuming the measurement is in decimal degrees, and not some other unit such as
gradians.

Most map projections use metres, but some use feet. Many use Eastings and Northings, but some are Northings and Eastings.
Some are Southings and Westings. Some are just X and Y, but some use X to mean East and others use it to mean North. Some
write the X coordinate first, some write the Y coordinate first. Just about every permutation of meaning and order
exists.

.. warning::
    When taking in coordinates from an external system, always, always, always check the **unit**, and the **order** of
    the numbers if they are not already clearly labelled.

Geographic
""""""""""
Geographic coordinates are those that use latitude/longitude (and optionally ellipsoid height).

Earth-centered (geocentric)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Longitudes are not of constant width, each degree covers a significantly wider area near the equator than
near the poles. This means any calculations involving them involves **a lot** of trigonometry. For this reason,
coordinates are sometimes expressed as 3 distances (3 axes...) from the centre of the Earth instead, with the axes angled
so as to respect the datum definition (one runs through the poles, one runs through the line of prime meridian). GPS
signals use this system, although the result is usually converted to latitude and longitude for display.

Projection (maps)
"""""""""""""""""
The 3D model describing the shape of the Earth is great from a scientific point of view, but comes with severe drawbacks
for everyday use. A pirate has not, and never will, carry around a pocket globe. It's just not practicable.

Like all humans, they prefer flat, foldable (portable!) maps.

.. sidebar:: Unpeeling the globe

    .. image:: images/segments.jpg

Apart from portability, one of the other main benefits of flat maps is that unlike latitudes and longitudes, map grids
have a fixed scale which makes measuring distances between points in everyday units such as metres nice and easy.

Unfortunately, there is no method of drawing out what is inherently a 3D shape onto a 2D surface whilst retaining full
fidelity. There are ways of maintaining accuracy of shape, but they involve distorting size. There are also ways to
maintain accurate size, but that involves some distortion of shape. Many mapmaking techniques aim for a compromise
between the two. Usually, the technique (called a projection) is chosen so that distortions are only noticeable at very
large scale e.g. maps that try to show entire countries at once. A well-produced map of e.g. a single town will not show
such effects.

Complicating things further, some projection methods work really well for tall, skinny areas (think Italy) but work much
less well on a more square-like areas (think France) so there are many methods in use worldwide.

.. note::

    All projected coordinate systems are based upon an existing geographic or geocentric system, and therefore have a
    datum and ellipsoid inside their formal definitions.

Vertical
""""""""
Because ellipsoidal heights are impractical to measure from the ground, it is common practice to ignore them completely
and measure heights using a completely different system (you might have heard of a height being referred to
as "above sea level"). A vertical coordinate system is by its nature 1 dimensional.

Compound
""""""""
A compound coordinate, is simply the combination of a 2D geographic or projected coordinate and 1D vertical coordinate.
Such a system is called 2D+1D to distinguish it from an actual 3D system such as a geocentric coordinate or a geographic
coordinate that includes an ellipsoid height.

Heights
^^^^^^^
What is a height? In everyday usage, a height would be described as a distance above (or potentially below) a reference
point. Easy. There are just 2 problems with that definition:

1) As discussed previously, defining something in terms of a real, physical point can produce difficulty in making
   measurements since it is not possible to determine the coordinates of your current location without having the
   known coordinates of a different point within sight
2) We also covered that a coordinate is a distance *and direction* from another point. As it turns out, "above" can be
   a complicated concept.

Before satellite positioning existed the first problem was ignored by mapmakers (or rather the practical difficulties
were accepted as necessary). Heights were measured off a fixed point because there simply wasn't an alternative. In the
UK mainland the basis for zero height is mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall as read off the tide gauge a hundred years
ago and a marker was placed to use as physical reference. For Northern Ireland, using a reference point in Cornwall is
physically impossible and thus a different sea-level based reference point was established in Belfast.

Other islands around the UK coast also have their own 0m markers, and countries worldwide all use similar systems, for
instance the US and Canada use a system based upon the water in the Great Lakes and France has historically measured
heights from a spot near Marseille.

.. admonition:: True Story

    In 2015, the primary marker for the American Samoa Vertical Datum on the island of Tutuila was destroyed
    in an earthquake. Other secondary markers with derived/calculated heights were present on the island, but the
    earthquake meant that they had moved too much to be considered reliable indicators of their claimed position and
    therefore could not safely be used to back-calculate where the original 0m height line was.

    As a result, the US was forced to declare the datum as obsolete and today when height information is needed
    fresh surveys have to be made based on a new 0m origin marker that has no relation to the previous origin.

.. caution::
    Despite all being based on sea level, the 0m Newlyn marker, the 0m Belfast marker, the 0m Marseille marker and
    any/all other markers in different countries have *absolutely nothing in common with each other and are not
    interchangeable*. They were created at different dates, and even if they had all been created on the same day, sea
    levels at different points on the globe are not equal.

Which way up?
"""""""""""""

The other problem is the "direction" of height. In order to work out the relative height of an arbitrary point compared
to the reference marker a surveyor needs to know what direction to make their measurements.

.. sidebar:: Flat Earther problems

    .. image:: images/heightdirection.png

Intuitively we think of the ground as a flat surface, and height is simply the direction perpendicular to the ground.
This works perfectly well for everyday usage such as a pirate burying treasure "6 feet below the ground".

However, if we introduce the concept of a hill to that mental model it starts to become ambiguous. If one person is
standing at the bottom of a hill, and another person is standing on it...are they at the same height (actual ground level)
or is one of them higher than the other?

Additionally, as any pirate who has every tried to look over the horizon from the crow's nest has figured out, the Earth
is not, in fact, flat. It's possible to have a mountain ("higher") located "below" the horizon.

.. sidebar:: Up is the opposite of down

    .. image:: images/heightdirection2.png

The actual, scientific answer to that conundrum is that "down" is the direction of gravity (i.e. towards the centre
of the Earth), and "up" is the same axis just going the other way. That is, every point on the Earth measures "height"
in a slightly different direction from every other point. That's not as bad as it initially sounds for a surveyor though
because they can use a spirit level to determine what direction that is. It's fiddly and requires a lot of care but is
doable, and a spirit level is part of every surveyors toolkit.

The results of those measurements reveal that the Earth's gravity does not actually point at the centre of the Earth.
At first glance that seems it must be wrong, but if you think back to how the Earth isn't actually a perfect ellipsoid,
and nor is the landmass on it equally distributed it starts to makes sense. The line of 0m height that is produced by
keeping the spirit level level, is therefore not ellipsoidal but it also does not follow the contours of the Earth's
physical surface. It is it's own unique imaginary shape (yes, another one) and is called the *local geoid*.

.. note::
    Confusingly, "geoid height" refers to the distance between the *geoid* and the *ellipsoid*. The distance between the
    geoid and what you're measuring is called *orthometric height*.

.. note::
    For most of a landmass, this does mean that just as an "ellipsoid height" is not related to anything the eye can see,
    neither are geoid based heights other than at that single primary marker point.

Although countries worldwide have tended to settle on using bodies of water to set their 0 height points, this is an
arbitrary choice. It makes most of the country have positive height numbers which has practical benefits, but
scientifically they could have chosen literally any point in the country to be 0 and done their spirit levelling from
there instead. There are an infinite number of potential 0 heights that could have been picked with their corresponding
geoids (before choosing sea level at Newlyn, UK mainland heights were actually measured from a church in Liverpool).

In the last few decades it has become possible to measure gravity from space. Not needing a stable surface and
spirit level means that measuring a geoid does not need to stop at the coast anymore, but can continue over oceans too.
That means that it is now possible for heights to actually be comparable and interoperable between different
landmasses. This *global geoid* is defined as the geoid that most closely aligns with global mean sea level.

.. note::
    This means the global geoid doesn't go through a single prone-to-destruction marker point and no country gets bragging
    rights to having the definition be based on their land, but it does involve measuring the entire ocean instead
    which obviously presents some practical difficulties.

    Most national mapping therefore continue to use a local geoid, because it allows them to restrict the necessary
    survey work to within their own territory.

In summary, coordinates can measure heights in any of the following ways:
 * a by-product of a 3-axis based geocentric coordinate system
 * the distance from the imaginary ellipsoid, in the direction away from the centre of the ellipsoid
 * the distance from an imaginary local geoid referenced to local mean sea level, in the opposite direction to gravity
 * the distance from an imaginary global geoid referenced to global mean sea level, in the opposite direction to gravity

with absolutely none of them being referenced to actual physical ground characteristics at all.

.. caution::
    This means if you're just trying to locate points on the Earth surface, it is probably better to use coordinates
    *without a height* rather than specify a zero height as that almost certainly doesn't mean what you intend it to.

    And if you are trying to reference a height compared to local surface level ("the treasure is 6 feet below ground",
    "that building is 100 metres tall") specify that information separately to the coordinates.

.. _explained_epochs:

Epochs
^^^^^^
The Earth is not a static environment. Melting glaciers cause sea levels to change. Earthquakes cause land to suddenly
shift in sudden (and often catastrophic) ways. And continental drift causes continents to slowly, but continuously
change position. It is therefore important for high accuracy to record *when* the measurements were made. This date
portion of a coordinate is called an *epoch*.

.. admonition:: True Story

    An operator of 2 oil platforms located near each other wanted to install a bridge between them.
    The first platform was installed in the 1990s, the second was installed in the 2010s. Both platforms had accurate
    locations recorded at time of installation, and so the corresponding distance and angle between them were calculated
    and a bridge was pre-fabricated on-shore and brought to sea.

    It didn't fit. The calculated gap between them was wrong because the coordinates of the two platforms were taken 20
    years apart. This mistake cost **millions** to fix.

.. tip::
    Geodesy tends to use decimal years for epochs, e.g. 2000.40, or 2021.00. For ease of use PHPCoord deviates from this
    and accepts dates in standard PHP ``DateTime``/``DateTimeImmutable`` format instead.

    If, like most people you don't have dates for your coordinates, you can also use ``null`` or leave blank entirely.


EPSG codes
----------
.. sidebar:: EPSG

    .. image:: images/EPSG.png

The oil and gas industry relies very heavily upon precision surveying - accurate information as to location is of
critical importance to them, not just on a day-to-day "is this drill positioned where we think it is?" basis
but also for legal and regulatory purposes such as obtaining the necessary licenses. Given that almost every country in
the world has its own coordinate system(s) and also that oil and gas fields do not stop at national boundaries, the
ability to convert between them is a frequent necessity.

For that reason, one of their trade associations, the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) maintains
a database of coordinate system definitions and how to transform between them for use by their members known as the
EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset. They also generously make it available at no charge to non-members.

This dataset (maintained since 1985, public since 1993) is so useful that it has become a de-facto standard, and it is
incorporated into many, many GIS applications. The usage of "EPSG codes" to reference specific coordinate systems
has actually become so standardised that IOGP accepts submissions for new ones that have absolutely no relevance to their
own members.

Example EPSG codes you may have seen include:
  * EPSG:4326 for WGS84 (GPS)
  * EPSG:4269 for NAD83 (North America)
  * EPSG:4258 for ETRS89 (Europe)

PHPCoord also makes use of the EPSG dataset although for the most part tries to make it an implementation
detail rather than something that users should be aware of. It is possible to use EPSG codes directly if you know them
(e.g. taking in data from an external system), but it's not necessary to know the relevant code to use the software.
